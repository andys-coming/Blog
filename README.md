# Delta Defense Blog Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the application locally

If you are using the GitHub CLI, then you can run the following command in your terminal in order to pull down the repository

## `gh repo clone andys-coming/Blog && cd Blog`

You can then run the following command in order to install all dependencies:

### `yarn`

You can then kick up the dev server in order to view it locally in your browser:

### `yarn test`

Enjoy;)
